      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a junior Software Engineer with a passion for creative problem-solving and a commitment to continuous learning. My skills include Ruby, Ruby on rails, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My background in the behavioral health field taught me how to break down complex challenges, collaborate with diverse teams, and stay grounded under pressureâ€”skills that now fuel my work as a developer. I bring curiosity, empathy, and persistence to every project, always looking for opportunities to grow and improve my craft.</p>
